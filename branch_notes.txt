Experiment 1 Notes

Regarding bug report: "XCode project has issues with splashscreen in SimpleTest"

URL: https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/issues/84


Brief:

The problem with the project is that the splash screen is not loading.

What I have observed so far, is that when I built the project using my shell scripts, the splash screen was loading.

However, when I went down the other paths, where I tried to preserve the project by using the workspace, I saw that the splash screen no longer comes back, but, going back to the original work, where the splash screen was working, no longer works. 

So, the original work I did probably didn't solve the problem, but masked it.
